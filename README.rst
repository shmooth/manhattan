Manhattan is a Python infrastructure block to provide basic server-side
analytics and multivariate testing. It is:

* **Easy** to deploy and develop on
* **Scalable** 
* **Not slow**, in-band request latency < 1ms and can process > 2k events/sec
* **Customizable** and flexible to varying rollup needs
* **Robust** to server failures, migrating between cluster topologies, and
  backend reconfiguration

It is also:

* 2 oz rye whiskey
* &frac12; oz sweet vermouth
* 2 dashes bitters
* 1 cherry
